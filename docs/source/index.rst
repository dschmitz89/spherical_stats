Welcome to spherical_stats's documentation!
===========================================
Spherical statistics in Python with a focus on accuracy and speed. Unlike many other implementations of spherical distributions, all probability distributions in spherical_stats are fitted exactly using numerical optimization and root-finding techniques and do not rely on approximations. Computationally intensive parts are accelerated using numba.

Installation
===========================================
.. code:: bash

   pip install spherical_stats

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
